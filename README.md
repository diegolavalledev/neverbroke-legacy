# Neverbroke - the app for the low-budget type

Neverbroke is a no-frills tool for managing your personal monthly budget. Set it up once by listing your categories and record each transaction with minimal data. Neverbroke will summarize all relevant information so you can see at a glance where you stand with your spending. You'll even get a *per diem* i.e. daily allowance calculated based on your remaining budget and the time of the month. Dig deeper to see charts and important insights on how to spend the rest of your money. Simple and effective, Neverbroke will help you get to next month with some spare cash.
